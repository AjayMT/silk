<h1 id="silk">Silk</h1>
<p>Silk is a small system programming language that I wrote for fun and clout. It is designed to be as flexible and simple as C, but more pleasant to write. To that end, Silk provides</p>
<ul>
<li>nicer syntax</li>
<li>a sophisticated type system (including parametric types!)</li>
<li>a sense of pride and accomplishment</li>
</ul>
<p>Silk does not aim to be as safe or fast as C++, Rust, etc. The LLVM backend (you didn’t think I wrote an end-to-end compiler, did you?) does all of the optimization.</p>
<p>As is true of many of my projects, Silk is currently <strong>alpha</strong>-stage software. Don’t expect it to work well (or at all).</p>
