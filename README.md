# Silk

Silk is a small system programming language that I wrote for fun and clout.
It is designed to be as flexible and simple as C, but more pleasant to write.
To that end, Silk provides

- nicer syntax
- a sophisticated type system (including parametric types!)
- a sense of pride and accomplishment

Silk does not aim to be as safe or fast as C++, Rust, etc. The LLVM backend (you didn't
think I wrote an end-to-end compiler, did you?) does all of the optimization.

As is true of many of my projects, Silk is currently **alpha**-stage software.
Don't expect it to work well (or at all).
